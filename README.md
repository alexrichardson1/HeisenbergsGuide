# CookOff
Website to help with Payday 2 mission: Cook Off.

During the mission, Bain will give you instructions to add ingredients (hydrogen chloride, muriatic acid, and caustic soda) to cook the meth in a
specific order for each batch. However, occasionally he makes mistakes, and adding one ingredient in the wrong order will result in the **meth lab
blowing up** and you will **NOT be able to cook any more meth**.

Bain will say specific dialogue for when an ingredient is either correct or incorrect. If you do not remember the dialogue then you will have to
wait until he mentions the **same ingredient TWICE**, which can slow the process down.

This website allows people who don't remember Bain's dialogue, to quickly discover if the ingredient he mentioned was correct or incorrect by
simply typing in what he said. I have also included a page for a general guide to the Cook Off mission.

All information regarding the mission is from this Steam guide: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=405540184
